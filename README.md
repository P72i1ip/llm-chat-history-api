# LLM Chat History API

## Project Overview

This project is a lightweight RESTful API for managing chat records from LLM (Large Language Model)-based conversations. It provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, searching, and managing chat histories, making it suitable for integration into SaaS products that support AI applications.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js** with **Express.js** (v4.x): API server
- **MongoDB** (Mongoose): Database
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **JWT**: User authentication & authorization
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: API documentation
- **Jest** or **Postman**: API testing

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Please use Express 4.x. Express 5.x is still in beta and may cause routing issues (e.g., `Missing parameter name`). Do not use 5.x.

## Features

- **User Management**: User registration and login (optional).
- **Authentication**: Secure endpoints using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete chat messages.
- **Search & Filter**: Search by keywords and filter by tags or date ranges.
- **API Documentation**: Interactive API documentation powered by Swagger.
- **Testing**: Manual testing with Postman or automated with Jest.
- **Docker Support**: `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for easy local deployment.

## Progress Checklist

- [x] Project initialization and structure

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/P72i1ip/llm-chat-history-api.git
cd llm-chat-history-api
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

The application requires environment variables to connect to the database and configure settings.

1.  Create a `.env` file in the project root. You can copy the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  Open the `.env` file and fill in your values, especially for `DATABASE` and `JWT_SECRET`.
3.  **Important:** Ensure the `PORT` is set to `8000` for consistency with the Docker setup.
    ```dotenv
    # .env
    PORT=8000
    DATABASE=mongodb+srv://...
    JWT_SECRET=...
    # ... other variables
    ```

### 3. Run the Application

You have two options to run the server. Docker is the recommended method as it provides a consistent environment.

---

#### Option A: Run with Docker (Recommended)

This method uses Docker to build and run the application in a container.

**Prerequisites:**

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.

**Instructions:**

> **Note:** You do not need to run `npm install` on your local machine. Docker will handle all dependencies inside the container.

To build the image and start the container, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

---

#### Option B: Run Locally

This method runs the application directly on your machine.

**Prerequisites:**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later) and npm installed.

**Instructions:**

1.  Install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## üöÄ Deployment

This project has been successfully deployed to **AWS ECS Fargate**.

For a detailed, end-to-end guide on the deployment process, including IAM setup, ECR push, and ECS service creation, please refer to the separate deployment guide.

## API Documentation

Once the application is running (using either method), you can access the interactive Swagger UI to explore and test all endpoints:

- **URL:** [http://localhost:8000/api-docs](http://localhost:8000/api-docs)

## Usage

- Use Postman or the Swagger UI to test all endpoints.
- For JWT-protected routes, log in first and use the returned token as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.
- Example requests and responses are available in the Swagger UI.

## Additional Notes

- All endpoints and sample requests/responses are documented in Swagger.
- Future improvements: advanced search (text index), more automated tests, and a CI/CD pipeline
